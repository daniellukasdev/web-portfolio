I am a developer currently living in Orlando, Florida.

With a background in 3D art and animation, I am interested in:



My passion for 3D art and animation led me to pursue a degree in computer animation.
Since graduating, I have been learning more about those things, but more importantly,
I've been learning about myself.
Those things that I thought I was most passionate about, actaully came in second
to something else.
All these years of gaining deeper knowledge of creating 3D content and tinkering 
with my computer and various parts of Linux, have led me to understand my real passion,
logic and problem-solving.

Software and web development invlove so much of that. Now, as a student at Thinkful,
I'm excited to finally be on my way to becoming a developer!
